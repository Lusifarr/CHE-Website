            <p> An oil spill is the release of a liquid petroleum hydrocarbon into the environment, especially the marine ecosystem, due to human activity, and is a form of pollution. The term is usually given to marine oil spills, where oil is released into the ocean or coastal waters, but spills may also occur on land. </p>

            <p>
                Even though it does not have a direct impact on water quality, urbanization and deforestation have a lot of indirect effects. For instance, cutting down trees and concreting over large areas generates an acceleration of flows which does not give enough time for water to infiltrate and be purified by the ground.

            <p>Agriculture has an impact on water pollution due to the use of chemicals such as fertilizers, pesticides, fungicides, herbicides or insecticides running off in the water, as well as livestock excrement, manure and methane (greenhouse effect). Regarding aquaculture, pollution is directly in the water, as excess food and fertilizers are causing dystrophication.</p>

            <h3>Cut Down on the Chemicals</h3>
            <p>Homeowners like to keep the yard looking green and healthy. This desire for a green lawn produces water pollution in two ways: Fertilizers and pesticides inevitably run off the shrubs and lawns and into the water. Select landscaping that is adapted to the climate.</p>

            <p>To prevent water pollution, the drains are required to be cleaned on a regular basis. In the rural areas, pucca drains are required to be made, because the water is going everywhere in a chaotic manner; it finally reaches the rivers and canals with tons of garbage and pollutants. We should develop a technology to keep the drains away from the water sources.</p>

            <p>The use of low quality water, such as treated wastewater in the industries and for washing utensils and gardening makes the fresh water less contaminated. Currently, water recycling is being only in a limited manner. So, we will have to stress more on proper recycling and reuse of water to prevent water pollution.</p>
